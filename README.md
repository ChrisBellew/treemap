Treemaps in JavaScript

An implementation for laying out rectangles in a Treemap, using the algorithm from Squarified Treemaps (1999) by Mark Bruls , Kees Huizing , Jarke van Wijk.

JavaScript is generated from TypeScript source.

See treemap.html for a usage demo or my previous blog post for an end result: http://nicnguyen.github.io/2012/06/04/Squarified-Treemaps-with-HTML5.html.
